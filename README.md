[Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) fork of  [Grayscale Jekyll Theme](https://jeromelachaud.github.com/grayscale-theme/)

There isn't really much more to say about it; it's a vanilla fork with only additional images (and content). It was originally based on [Grayscale bootstrap theme ](http://ironsummitmedia.github.io/startbootstrap-grayscale/)
